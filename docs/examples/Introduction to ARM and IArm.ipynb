    "Welcome to the introduction to ARM assembly and IArm\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is ARM?\n",
    "ARM is a RISC CPU architecture that is commonly used on embeded devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is Assembly?\n",
    "Assembly is a low level programming language.\n",
    "It is generally used for very performant code, very efficient code,\n",
    "or for direct access to the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is IArm?\n",
    "IArm is an ARM assembly language interpreter.\n",
    "Normally, assembly is compiled from the source code to machine code.\n",
    "This machine code is then run on the CPU.\n",
    "IArm allows you to write code on your computer, and run it step by step,\n",
    "without the need for the actual hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How do I write assembly?\n",
    "Each assembly line is broken up into three parts.\n",
    "The first part is the label.\n",
    "The label is used to reference whatever this particular line of code is.\n",
    "It can be used for loops, or for holding addresses of memory.\n",
    "The label is optional, so only use it when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part is the instruction.\n",
    "This is the actual instruction that will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part is the instruction operands.\n",
    "These will be used by the instruction to perform the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "`[Label] Instruction [Operand1[, Operand2[, Operand3]]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that if no label is used,\n",
    "the instruction must be spaced or tabbed over.\n",
    "Any word that begins on a line with no spaces to\n",
    "the left will be interpreted as as a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Putting values into registers\n",
    "The first instruction is the `MOVS` instruction.\n",
    "`MOVS` stands for \"Move, set\" which will move the value of\n",
    "operand 2 into the register in operand 1 and set the status register.\n",
    "The `MOVS` instruction must be used to load in immediate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments can also be added, and start with `;`.\n",
    "Anything after a `;` will be ignored."
